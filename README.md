# Mutli-Threaded Prime Range
This is a set of three programs, each one finding all prime numbers in a range dictated by the user. One program is sequential, one program is multi-threaded using open mp, and the other is multi-threaded using posix threads. Each folder includes the makefile for the given program. prange.cpp, once made, takes two arguments. The arguments are the begining of the range and the end of the range. The other two programs take 3 arguments. These arguments are the begining of the range, the end of the range, and the amount of threads desired. The program will output all the primes found as well as the amount of time the program took to find those primes.
